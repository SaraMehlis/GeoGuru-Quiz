## User Experience (UX)
As a user, I want:

- a geographical quiz so that I can test my knowledge
- to be able to set timers, difficulty levels, and customize the quiz settings so that I can choose my preferences for the quiz.
- to have accessibility features, like colour contrast and adjustable font sizes so that I can have the same experience as other users
- to see my current score displayed prominently on the screen so that I can track my progress
- the score area to display my highest score achieved in previous quiz sessions so that I can challenge myself and improve over time
- to be able to share my quiz results so that I can show my friends and compare results.
- to  Include a feature for users to provide feedback on questions, so that report errors, or suggest new quiz topics.
- to be informed about the number of questions remaining in the quiz, so that I can anticipate how much more time I need to allocate for completing the quiz.

## Features
- __Start button__
  - The start button is essential when doing a quiz because it initiates the quiz process and prevents the timer from starting prematurely.It creates a clear starting point for the quiz, allowing participants to mentally prepare and focus their attention on the questions ahead.

<!--add description to the features later-->
- __Skip button__
  - We added this feature to allow users to skip to the next question if they aren't confident in answering them.

- __Score area__
  - Score area for users to clearly see which questions they got correct or incorrect.

- __Restart button__
  - Restart button to allow users to restart the quiz and try again if they weren't happy with their score and to also let their friends and family have a go.

- __Alert message__
  - Alert message will pop up if the user has ran out of time on a question and skips to the next question. There is also an alert message to notify the user when the quiz has ended.
